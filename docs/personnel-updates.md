## üìù Step 2: Format the CSV File

Once you have exported the file, ensure that it is properly formatted with the following columns:
- **SURNAME**
- **NAME**
- **SCHOOL LEVEL**
- **GRADE**

The data should look something like this:

```csv
"SURNAME","NAME","SCHOOL LEVEL","GRADE"
"Smith","John","Junior School","Grade 3"
"Johnson","Emily","Middle School","Grade 7"
"Doe","Jane","Senior School","Grade 12"
"Brown","Michael","Junior School","Grade 5"
"James","Bob",,
```
**NOTE**: Staff Names will simply have no grade or school level (see last line). The real file will likely be alphabetical by surname, but any order is fine.
